# Data URI Generator

A simple static web app that converts input text into a Base64-encoded Data URI with MIME type `text/plain`. Now also supports uploading files to generate their Data URI with correct MIME type.

## Usage
1. Enter your text into the textarea OR upload a file.
2. Click the "Generate Data URI" button.
3. The resulting Data URI will appear in the read-only output field.
4. Use the "Copy" button to copy the Data URI to clipboard.
5. Use the "Clear" button to reset inputs.
6. Use the "Download" button to save the Data URI as a text file.

## Cloning
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```
Open `index.html` in your web browser to use the app.
